# Fleet Logistics Analytics Dashboard

This project is an interactive web-based analytics dashboard designed to visualize key performance indicators in a logistics and delivery fleet operation.

## 📊 Overview
The dashboard provides insights into fleet composition, delivery volume trends, driver performance, vehicle maintenance, and fuel efficiency. Each chart is sourced from a distinct dataset and uses a unique visual strategy to represent the data meaningfully.

## 📁 Data Sources
All data is synthetic and generated to simulate a real-world logistics context. The following five CSV files are used:

1. **Deliveries.csv** – Monthly delivery totals with regional distribution
2. **FleetComposition.csv** – Vehicle type breakdown (Truck, Van, Electric, etc.)
3. **DriverPerformance.csv** – Driver KPIs including safety, punctuality, and fuel efficiency
4. **Maintenance.csv** – Vehicle maintenance tasks, costs, and status
5. **FuelDistance.csv** – Relationship between trip distance and fuel usage

## 📐 Dashboard Layout
The layout uses Bootstrap 4 for responsive design. Charts are arranged using column and row combinations to reflect importance and function:

- **Row 1**: Large line chart (Deliveries) + small pie chart (Fleet Composition)
- **Row 2**: Three medium charts — radar (Driver KPIs), doughnut (Maintenance), and scatter (Fuel vs. Distance)

## 📈 Chart Types Used
- **Line Chart** – Delivery trends over time
- **Pie Chart** – Fleet composition
- **Radar Chart** – Driver performance
- **Doughnut Chart** – Maintenance status
- **Scatter Plot** – Fuel vs. distance efficiency

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 & Bootstrap 4
- Chart.js for chart rendering
- PapaParse for CSV data parsing
- JavaScript for dynamic chart population

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the five `.csv` files in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
